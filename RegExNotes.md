# Character Classes

## Sets of characters

Use square brackes **\[\]** to match one character from a choice of characters.  Dashes (minus sign) are used to specify a range of characters.

* **\[ae\]** - matches either "a" or "e" as in **gr\[ae]y** which will match either gray or grey.
* **\[3-8\]** - matches a single digit between 3 and 8.
* **\[a-z\]** - match all lowercase letters
* **\[A-Z\]** - match all uppercase letters
* **\[A-Z0-9\]** - match all uppercase letters and all single digits

## Character class shortcuts

* **\\d** - match a digit 0-9
* **\\w** - match a "word" character, an alphanumeric character plus the underscore.  Word boundaries are separated by whitespace.
* **\\s** - match a whitespace (space or tab)

## Non-printable characters

* **\\n** - match the newline character
* **\\r** - match the carriage return (on Windows search for **\\r\\n**)
* **\\t** - match a horizontal tab

## Wildcard character match

**.** - **gr.y** matches gray and grey, or any other character in the 3rd position

## Match start and end of strings

* **^** - **^This** matches in "This is a test" since "This" is at the start of the string.
* **^** - **^test** does not match in "This is a test" since "test" is NOT at the start of the string.
* **$** - **test$** matches "This is a test" since the string ends with "test"
* Combined - **^Hi there$** matches the entire 'Hi there" string since it begins with "Hi" and ends with "there"
